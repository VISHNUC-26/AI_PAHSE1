## Getting Started

Follow the instructions below to run the code and reproduce the analysis.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- Pandas
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

You can install these libraries using pip:

~~~ bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
~~~

### Running the Code

1.Clone this repository to your local machine:
~~~ bash

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis-marketing.git
~~~
1.Navigate to the project directory:
~~~ bash

cd sentiment-analysis-marketing
~~~
1.Download the dataset from Kaggle using the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment

2.Load and preprocess the dataset by running the code in Jupyter Notebook or your preferred Python environment. Make sure to provide the path to your downloaded dataset:

~~~ python

# Load and preprocess the dataset
import pandas as pd

# Provide the path to your downloaded dataset
dataset_path = 'path_to_downloaded_dataset.csv'

data = pd.read_csv(dataset_path)
# (Add the data preprocessing and analysis code here)
~~~
1.Train and evaluate the sentiment analysis model by running the code:
~~~ python
# Train and evaluate the model
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Step 1: Selecting a Machine Learning Algorithm (Logistic Regression)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['text'], data['sentiment'], test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Convert text data to numerical features using TF-IDF Vectorization
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(max_features=5000)
X_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(X_train)
X_test = vectorizer.transform(X_test)

# Initialize and train the Logistic Regression model
model = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the test data
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model's performance
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
report = classification_report(y_test, y_pred)

print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}")
print(report)
~~~
1.Visualize the model's performance, including the confusion matrix:
~~~ python

# Visualize the model's performance
# Create a confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)

# Visualize the confusion matrix
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.heatmap(cm, annot=True, fmt='d', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=model.classes_, yticklabels=model.classes_)
plt.xlabel('Predicted')
plt.ylabel('True')
plt.title('Confusion Matrix')
plt.show()
~~~
1.Document the project and prepare it for submission.

*   **analysis.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
*   **README.md:** This file.

## Conclusion
### Summary of Each Phase
### Phase 1: Problem Definition and Design Thinking

Phase 1 was dedicated to understanding the problem of performing sentiment analysis on customer feedback to gain insights into competitor products. We outlined a design plan that included data collection, preprocessing, sentiment analysis techniques, feature extraction, visualization, and insights generation.
### Phase 2: Innovation

In Phase 2, we focused on innovative approaches to solving the problem, aiming to transform the design into actionable solutions that can provide valuable marketing insights.
### Phase 3: Development Part 1

Phase 3 marked the beginning of the project's implementation. We loaded and preprocessed the dataset, laying the foundation for subsequent analysis and model development.
### Phase 4: Development Part 2

In Phase 4, we selected a machine learning algorithm (Logistic Regression), trained the model, and evaluated its performance. We also visualized the results, including the confusion matrix.
### Phase 5: Project Documentation & Submission

In the final phase, Phase 5, we documented the entire project, from problem definition to innovative techniques. This documentation is essential for project submission and assessment.
### Final Conclusions
In conclusion, this sentiment analysis project for marketing has provided a structured approach to understanding customer sentiments and extracting valuable insights. By leveraging natural language processing techniques, we have equipped companies with the tools to improve their products, identify strengths and weaknesses, and make data-driven marketing decisions.

The project has demonstrated the power of sentiment analysis in a marketing context and the significance of each phase in the process. The documentation ensures that the project is ready for submission and evaluation.

We hope this project serves as a valuable resource for businesses looking to harness the power of sentiment analysis for marketing success.

Thank you for joining us on this journey through the phases of this project!
